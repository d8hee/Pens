Pens
A journal app that lets users store and manage journal entries easily. 

This project used node.js, mongoose, express, and ejs to create a full stack application. 

The file structure of this project followed a Models/Views/Controllers structure, dividing files on the information in them (data base models, paged to be viewed/displayed, and controller files with routes). 

User story: As an avid journaler, I want to be able to write and store all my journal entries on my phone, so that I can look back on my entries whenever/wherever I want.

Upcoming features that I would want to incorporate:
-A search bar that allows users to search entries by keyword
-Incorporating user authentication to make posts private
-An option for users to change background colour
