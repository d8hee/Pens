## Technologies Used

Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose, EJS, dotenv, method-override, HTML/CSS/Javscript,Heroku


## Approach

I started by creating a simple CRUD app that would allow users to create new posts, edit, view, and delete them as needed. Once I ensured that all the routes were working, I incorporated sessions an authentication. This was so users would have their own profile page, to view only the posts that were created by them. 

## User Story

As an avid journaler, I want to be able to write and store all my journal entries on my phone, so that I can look back on my entries whenever/wherever I want.

## Unsolved Problems
Navigating through the page: Currently, the layout of the buttons is not exactly to my liking. I would like to redesign the navigation structure of the pages, to match how I want the experience to be for the user as they navigate through the website.

## Notes to self
- I would like to build a feature to make posts private
- Create an option for users to change background colour of their posts
- create a search bar that allows users to search entries by keyword
